## Twitch Bot
Basic Twitch Bot using Conduits and Websockets. Required a mariadb or any db of your choosing (you have to change the queries tho)

To get the user access token for the bot account:
Create a new twitch application (https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) set the OAuth redirect URL to `http://localhost:8888` and select `private` as client-type.

Make sure to save the client id and client secret in your .env file. 

Next, add the client_id to this url and paste it in your browser:
**when getting the auth token make sure you're logged in with the twitch account from your bot**

`https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>
&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888
&response_type=code

You then should be redirected. In the url, search for a parameter "code=<YOUR CODE>"
Copy this code.

Next step is to send a POST-Request to twitch, use your preferred method to do so. I'll be using reqbin.com
make sure to replace client_id and client_secret from your app, and code from the url before.

set the url to `https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token`
set the content type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
set the data to `client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>&code=<CODE_FROM_BEFORE>&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888`

the entire request should look something like:
```
curl -X POST 'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token'
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
-d 'client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>&code=<CODE_FROM_BEFORE>&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888'
```

you'll receive the access_token and refresh_token.
head to your database and insert these into the `tokens` table. make sure to set the name to `bot-token`. enter access_token and refresh_token to the values you got from the post request, leave `expires_at` at 0.

that's it, you're done.
